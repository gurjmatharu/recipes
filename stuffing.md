## Stuffing Recipe

### Ingredients:

- 1 loaf of artisanal rustic bread
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) high-quality unsalted butter
- 1 cup finely chopped onions
- 1 cup finely chopped celery
- 2 tbsp fresh sage, finely chopped
- 1 1/2 cups homemade chicken or vegetable broth
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Cube the artisanal bread and spread it on a baking sheet. Toast in the oven until the cubes are lightly golden (about 10 minutes). Remove and set aside.

2. **Sautéing:**
   - In a skillet over medium heat, melt the high-quality unsalted butter. Add finely chopped onions and celery. Sauté until they become soft and translucent, bringing out their sweetness (about 5-7 minutes).

3. **Herb Infusion:**
   - Introduce finely chopped fresh sage to the sautéed mixture. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Continue to cook for an additional 2 minutes to infuse the flavors.

4. **Combining Ingredients:**
   - Place the toasted bread cubes in a large bowl. Pour the sautéed mixture over the bread cubes and gently toss until well combined.

5. **Moistening the Stuffing:**
   - Gradually add homemade chicken or vegetable broth to the mixture, ensuring it reaches your desired level of moisture. You don't want it too dry or too soggy.

6. **Baking:**
   - Transfer the stuffing mixture to a greased baking dish.

7. **Final Bake:**
   - Bake the stuffing uncovered at 350°F (175°C) for 25-30 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and crispy.

8. **Serve:**
   - Once done, remove from the oven and serve your delicious stuffing. Enjoy!
